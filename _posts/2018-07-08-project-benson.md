title: Predicting the density of potential contributors at the WTWY gala
---
### Question to answer
The WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is a non-profit organization devoted to strengthen the role of women in technology. Every year in early summer a funding raising gala is celebrated. The persons attending the event are invited after giving their contact information to street teams working for WTWY. It is essential for this organization to maximize the number of people interacting with the teams but even more important is to optimize the potential donors attending the gala. Exploratory data analysis can be used to predict the best way to employ the teams.    

### Results

### Conclusion
 We are able to identify the locations and times of the week for which the number of potential contributors to the gala is maximized.
