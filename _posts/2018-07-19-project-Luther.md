title: Helping to make the citizens richer!
---
In this project a model is developed to examine the relationship between the influence of some characteristics of a city with the salary of their inhabitants. City governments can use the results to find effective ways to enhance the household incomes of their fellow citizens.

### Examined factors and sources
Our study is restricted to cities larger than 100000 within USA with a number of features considered namely population, land area city, touristical importance of the city, rent prices for appartments and crime rates. Population (estimated July 2017) and land area (as of January 2016) were scrapped from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population) being the original source the US Census Bureau. Number of things to do as listed in [https://www.tripadvisor.com/](https://www.tripadvisor.com/) was taken as the quantitative indicator for the touristical importance of each city. Very recent data (June 2018) for the rent appartment prices was scrapped from [www.apartmentlist.com](https://www.apartmentlist.com/).

Crime rates for murders and assaults (number per 100000 persons on 2016) as well as the parameter we want to estimate, median income, were obtained from [www.city-data.com](http://www.city-data.com/)
